<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">How to Unlock Huawei E160 modem</span></strong><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></strong>Having successfully unlocked my Huawei modem I was so excited I decided to blog about it so that i do not forget and I can have a reference point for others.Here is how I did it:</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">Firstly to unlock the modem you need  to get its IMEI number  which is a long code behind the modem such as "354765037712570"</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">the next step is to visit this webpage <a href="http://a-zgsm.com/huawei.php">http://a-zgsm.com/huawei.php</a></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">and put in your IMEI number where you will be given an unlock code such as "61955552"</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">then connect your modem to the computer</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">the next step is to download a piece of software from <span style="color: #008800; font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://www.nextgenserver.com/files/huawei_code_tool.exe"><span style="font-size: x-small;">http://www.nextgenserver.com/files/huawei_code_tool.exe</span></a></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">in that software as shown in the picture click the button to scan for huawei dongle and then select a port from the drop down list  and add the code to the text box for the unlock code and click send code . Once successfully unlocked you will get a message that code accepted.</div>
