<p>I was lucky enough to attend Garage48 sometime this month as a developer and it was enriching and fun but that is not the best thing that came out of there. Put aside the other numerous wonderful projects I choose to work with Mafuta go to bring the idea to life and I have not looked back .Basically the application is web and mobile solution to provide users with accurate information on fuel prices and services at fuel stations with a focus on Ugandan suburbs . The project is still in alpha phases but will soon get a full rollout .I am currently working on the web side of the business this is a sample of what I have so far<img src="/images/jTDkZT3YAvuov.png" alt="mafutago" />this is still work in progress but u can always show your support viewing our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mafutago" target="_blank">facebook page </a>.</p>
